The team could re-sign Trubisky or pursue another experienced reserve.' },

Johnson has impressed, with 25 of his 42 catches gaining a first down. Barring the addition of a Day 3 pick or inexpensive free agent, Buffalo is well-positioned at running back with a complementary trio.' },

Keon Coleman, entering his third year, was next with 116 targets. Coleman was also the target of comments by Terry Pegula at an offseason news conference. Buffalo needs a true WR1 after reportedly offering a first-round pick for Jaylen Waddle at the trade deadline. They may pursue upgrades via trade or free agency and could potentially work with the Eagles to acquire A.J. Brown for a Day 2 pick.' },

Dawkins’ OLi score of  71.7 (C-) was his worst over the last seven years. The Bills are expected to have two backup tackles return, but they could still use some depth. A low-cost free agent could fill this spot.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 3.5, writeup: 'O’Cyrus Torrence is the only guard signed for next season. David Edwards started 16 games and will be a free agent. Buffalo must strengthen both depth and starting talent at this spot going forward.' },

Rousseau finished 39th in the EDGEi rankings after placing in the top 15 during the previous three years. Buffalo must upgrade at EDGE to consistently pressure the quarterback and ease the burden on the secondary. They can address this need in free agency or in the early rounds of the draft.' },

If released, up to $99 million in cap space could be consumed, depending on timing and method. This decision at quarterback will shape their approach to other positions. Another key decision is how much confidence Miami has in Quinn Ewers, with the possibility that he could compete in training camp for the starting role against a veteran free agent. Miami could also draft a rookie quarterback, such as Ty Simpson, or target a Day 2 pick to add competition for Ewers.' },

    { position: 'Cornerback', needLevel: 10, writeup: 'Miami must address a significant need at cornerback after trading Jalen Ramsey. Rasul Douglas and Jack Jones, ranked 15th and 63rd in CBi, will become free agents. Jason Marshall Jr., ranked 125th, is the top cornerback under contract for 2026. Miami will likely use a Day 1 or Day 2 pick or invest in a starting-level free agent to fill the need.' },
    { position: 'Safety', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Minkah Fitzpatrick’s SAFi score of 73.6 (C) was his lowest in seven years, but Fitzpatrick and Dante Trader Jr. remain under contract. Ashtyn Davis and Ifeatu Melifonwu will be free agents. Safety is not a top priority, but adding a Day 3 pick could improve depth.' }

    { position: 'Wide Receiver', needLevel: 3.5, writeup: 'Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte, Mack Hollins, and Demario Douglas, all under contract for next season, finished in the top 31 in WRi. Diggs, in his first season with New England, placed 4th with an 87.0 (B+). Wide receiver is not a critical offseason need.' },

Henry, who finished 11th, is under contract next season; Hooper will enter free agency. The Patriots need a top-tier receiving weapon to aid Maye’s development. This could be an early Day 3 pick if they believe the player can develop over the next year.' },

    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 1.25, writeup: 'Garrett Bradbury is under contract for next season after finishing as the 19th-ranked center with an 80.4 (B-). Like most other offensive positions, there’s no urgent need, and building depth should be a priority.' },
    { position: 'EDGE', needLevel: 10, writeup: 'No Patriot cracked the top 40 in EDGEi; Harold Landry was 46th and K\'Lavon Chaisson 48th. Landry is expected back; Chaisson is a free agent. More depth and production are needed through the draft or free agency if the right fit appears.' },

When Wilson didn’t work out, they brought in Aaron Rodgers, and that didn’t work. Now, with the number two pick, they appeared set to draft Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza or Oregon’s Dante Moore. However, Moore returned to college, and the Jets now face the choice of drafting a quarterback at number two or trading down if they feel that pick is too high for their preferred option.' },
    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Breece Hall is a free agent; New York may use the franchise tag to retain him. If not, Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis will be the main backs. Allen missed most of the season with an injury but performed well in limited action over the last two years. The Jets will bring in low-level free agents or undrafted free agents to fill out the depth unless a surprise running back falls to them in the draft.' },
    { position: 'Wide Receiver', needLevel: 8, writeup: 'Garrett Wilson will lead the Jets’ receiving corps next season, but the rest of the unit is uncertain. With Adonai Mitchell and Isaiah Williams signed through 2026, yet both earning a D grade in WRi this year, this group remains unsettled. Improving receiver depth will be targeted in free agency and later draft rounds, in line with similar roster-building priorities.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Mason Taylor and Jeremy Ruckert both return for next season, but they had below-average seasons, ranking 52nd and 58th in TEi. Strengthening this position with a Day 3 pick could help support a young quarterback and the evolving offense.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Tackle', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'The Jets have invested heavily in offensive tackle, using their first picks in the last two seasons to build the position. Armand Membou, last year’s seventh overall pick, had a good first season with a 78.4 (C+) OLi. Olu Fashanu, the 11th overall pick in the 2024 draft, had an OLi of 73.8 (C). Given this recent investment, the team is unlikely to allocate further significant resources to this position, allowing focus to shift elsewhere.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Joe Tippmann, who shifted from center to guard, has performed at least at an average level in his three seasons. With John Simpson set to hit free agency, interior depth may become a minor draft or free agent target, aligning with the approach to other positions.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Josh Myers played 100% of the offensive snaps this season and is under contract for two more seasons, leaving center as one of the more settled positions as the team turns to other roster areas.' },
    { position: 'EDGE', needLevel: 7.5, writeup: '2023 first-round pick Will McDonald IV has a C grade in EDGEi for the last two seasons. Braiden McGregor and Jermaine Johnson II are under contract for next season, but both had below-average seasons according to EDGEi. Despite depth, the Jets will now seek a playmaker at EDGE through the draft or free agency, further advancing their defensive roster reshaping.' },
    { position: 'Defensive Tackle', needLevel: 8.25, writeup: 'Trading Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys created a void on the Jets’ defensive line. Harrison Phillips, Mazi Smith, and Payton Page are the only defensive tackles under contract for next season. Phillips ranked 84th in DTi with a 69.8 (D+) score. Depending on how the Jets decide to add a quarterback, this will likely be addressed in free agency or on Day 2 of the draft.' },
    { position: 'Linebacker', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Jamien Sherwood recorded an 86.1 (B) to finish 16th in LBi and will return next season as the linebacker to build around. Quincy Williams enters free agency after reduced snaps post-trade deadline, making it likely the Jets will use free agency and the draft to address linebacker depth as part of their defensive overhaul.' },
    { position: 'Cornerback', needLevel: 1.9, writeup: 'The Jets traded Sauce Gardner to the Colts to build draft capital. Several cornerbacks return, including Azareye\'h Thomas, Brandon Stephens, and Qwan\'Tez Stiggers, but adding another contributor on Day 3 remains a priority as the team continues to refresh the secondary.' },
    { position: 'Safety', needLevel: 3, writeup: 'Malachi Moore is currently the only Jets safety under contract who played more than 16% of defensive snaps, and his SAFi was below league average, earning a D+ grade.

    { position: 'Quarterback', needLevel: 1.25, writeup: 'Lamar Jackson is a two-time NFL MVP and the unquestioned franchise cornerstone. He threw for over 4,000 yards again in 2025 despite dealing with hamstring and back injuries that cost him time throughout the year. The bigger concern is his $74.5 million cap hit in 2026, which will require a restructure to give the front office breathing room. With Jesse Minter stepping in as head coach, Jackson enters the most pivotal phase of his career.' },
    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Derrick Henry turned in another monster season (1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns at 5.2 yards per carry). The 31-year-old now sits fifth all-time in career rushing TDs and shows few signs of slowing down. Keaton Mitchell flashed explosive ability and is a restricted free agent who the Ravens should retain. Justice Hill and Rasheen Ali provide additional depth.' },
    { position: 'Wide Receiver', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Zay Flowers earned his first Pro Bowl selection and crossed 1,000 yards again, firmly establishing himself as a legitimate WR1 at just 24. Rashod Bateman settled into a reliable complementary role. DeAndre Hopkins was signed as veteran depth but contributed mostly as a role player at this stage. The Ravens could still use a vertical threat to stretch defenses. Still, this is the best the receiver position has looked in Baltimore in a long time.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 3, writeup: 'Mark Andrews signed a three-year extension midseason and remains one of the league\'s premier receiving TEs when healthy, providing Jackson with his most trusted red-zone weapon. Charlie Kolar offers a reliable blocking presence and occasional receiving contributions. The question mark is Isaiah Likely, who dealt with foot injuries throughout 2025 and is now a pending UFA.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Tackle', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'The Ravens locked up Ronnie Stanley on a three-year, $60 million extension, keeping one of the league\'s best left tackles in Baltimore for the foreseeable future. On the right side, Roger Rosengarten developed impressively throughout his first two seasons and projects as a long-term starter. This is one of the more stable tackle duos in the AFC.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 8.5, writeup: 'Andrew Vorhees and Daniel Faalele started at left and right guard, respectively, in 2025, and while both showed flashes in the run game, they were inconsistent in pass protection. Faalele is a pending free agent, and even if he returns, the Ravens need legitimate competition or an upgrade.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Tyler Linderbaum is arguably the best center in football, earning his third consecutive Pro Bowl selection at just 25. He is the heartbeat of the offensive line and the linchpin of their dominant rushing attack. Linderbaum is a pending UFA who will command top-of-market money, and with Jackson\'s $74.5 million cap number looming, retaining him won\'t be cheap. But GM Eric DeCosta has made it clear that keeping Linderbaum is a priority, and it would be stunning if Baltimore let him walk.' },
    { position: 'EDGE', needLevel: 10, writeup: 'The pass rush completely cratered in 2025; Baltimore failed to produce a single edge rusher with six or more sacks for the first time since 1996. Kyle Van Noy plummeted from 12.5 sacks in 2024 to just two in 2025 and is a soon-to-be 35-year-old UFA unlikely to return. Dre\'Mont Jones was a solid midseason trade acquisition (2.5 sacks and 15 QB hits in nine games) but is also a UFA who may price himself out. David Ojabo never developed into the impact player the Ravens hoped, and he\'s a free agent, too. Rookie Mike Green showed promise with 3.5 sacks but is a developmental piece thrust into too large a role too soon. The cupboard is essentially bare.' },
    { position: 'Defensive Tackle', needLevel: 8, writeup: 'The loss of Nnamdi Madubuike cannot be overstated. The two-time Pro Bowler suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 2, and as of January 2026, his future remains uncertain. His $31 million cap hit looms regardless of whether he plays. Travis Jones emerged as the unit\'s best player, posting a team-leading 47 pressures and five sacks, and the Ravens wisely locked him up with an extension. But beyond Jones, there\'s a significant drop-off. The Ravens need another interior disruptor who can generate pressure, especially under a new head coach whose defensive philosophy relies on a dominant front.' },
    { position: 'Linebacker', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Roquan Smith is one of the best linebackers in football. The four-time Pro Bowler and All-Pro selection is the vocal leader of the defense. Kyle Hamilton frequently operates in a hybrid linebacker role as well, giving the Ravens versatility few defenses can match. The 1.5 rating simply accounts for depth behind Smith; if he were to miss significant time, the drop-off would be steep.' },
    { position: 'Cornerback', needLevel: 5.5, writeup: 'The situation is in flux. Marlon Humphrey had a disastrous 2025 season, and his $20 million cap hit makes him a strong cut or trade candidate. On the positive side, Nate Wiggins emerged as a stud in his second season, leading the team in passes defensed and playing over 1,000 defensive snaps. Chidobe Awuzie played well as a free agent pickup but is a UFA himself. If Humphrey is cut, the Ravens save nearly $19.3 million but would need to find at least one starting-caliber corner to pair with Wiggins.' },
    { position: 'Safety', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Kyle Hamilton is the best safety in football, and it\'s not particularly close. The third-year star earned his third consecutive Pro Bowl nod and continues to redefine the position with his size, range, and football IQ. Alongside Hamilton, the Ravens added Alohi Gilman in the Odafe Oweh trade, and he stepped into a larger role after Ar\'Darius Washington tore his Achilles. The Ravens also drafted Malaki Starks in the first round of the 2025 draft. This is the deepest and most talented safety room in the NFL.' }

  'cincinnati-bengals': [
    { position: 'Quarterback', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Joe Burrow is a franchise quarterback and one of the five best passers in the NFL when healthy. The problem is staying healthy. A Grade 3 turf toe injury in Week 2 cost him nine games in 2025, and when he returned, he was clearly not himself, finishing with just 1,809 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, and five interceptions across eight appearances. But Burrow\'s talent is undeniable. At 29, he remains firmly in his prime with massive investments in Ja\'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins surrounding him.' },
    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 1.25, writeup: 'Chase Brown cemented himself as a legitimate feature back in 2025, finishing with 1,500+ yards from scrimmage and 11 TDs. Zack Moss provides veteran depth, though the Bengals could look for a dynamic complement to spell Brown and keep him fresh.' },
    { position: 'Wide Receiver', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'The Bengals locked up the most expensive receiving duo in NFL history, and it\'s worth every penny. Ja\'Marr Chase earned his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection and another All-Pro nod, crossing 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season on his record-setting $161 million extension. Tee Higgins was re-signed through 2028 and posted a career-high 11 touchdowns. The depth after that is average at best, so perhaps a dart throw in the middle rounds makes sense.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Mike Gesicki\'s bounce-back 2024 season (65 catches for 665 yards, the second-most receptions by a tight end in Bengals history) earned him a three-year, $25.5 million extension. He\'s a mismatch weapon from the slot who gives Burrow a reliable intermediate target and red-zone option. The 2025 season was disrupted when Gesicki landed on IR with a pectoral injury in Week 6, but at full health, this is a strong position with depth options behind him.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Tackle', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'The Bengals have two quality bookend tackles locked in. Orlando Brown Jr. had a solid 2025 campaign at left tackle after his injury-plagued 2024, and the offensive line as a whole was graded seventh overall by PFSN with a 79.7 score (a significant improvement from preseason expectations). On the right side, Amarius Mims continued developing as a young, high-ceiling starter. The tackle spots are stable with no significant concerns entering the offseason.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'The interior offensive line was a question mark entering 2025, particularly after Cordell Volson, the starting left guard since 2022, went down with a season-ending injury during training camp. Dylan Fairchild stepped in, and the unit performed better than expected. The steady play of veteran Dalton Risner also helped stabilize things. The 1.5 rating accounts for the need to solidify depth and potentially upgrade one starting spot, but this is no longer the glaring weakness it was projected to be.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Ted Karras has been the Bengals\' most consistent offensive lineman, but he is 32 and won\'t be the long-term answer.

Sam Hubbard retired. Joseph Ossai never developed into a reliable starter and is also a free agent. Myles Murphy showed some improvement late but has largely been a disappointment since being drafted in the first round in 2023. Rookie first-rounder Shemar Stewart has elite athletic tools (a perfect 10.0 Relative Athletic Score) but missed nine games due to injuries and remains a major unknown. The cupboard is dangerously thin. With the 10th overall pick, edge rusher should be at the top of the board, and free agency spending here is critical.' },
    { position: 'Defensive Tackle', needLevel: 10, writeup: 'The Bengals\' most dire need, even more than EDGE. The interior defensive line has been unable to generate consistent pressure for years, and the lack of a disruptive interior pass rusher has handicapped the entire defensive scheme. B.J. Hill is a reliable run-stuffing starter signed through 2027, but he\'s not the kind of interior disruptor who collapses the pocket. Kris Jenkins Jr. showed flashes as a rookie in 2024 but landed on IR in 2025, and Sheldon Rankins was a complete non-factor. The free agent market for interior pass-rushers is thin this cycle, making the draft even more important.' },

But the departure of both Germaine Pratt and Akeem Davis-Gaither gutted the depth. Second-round pick Demetrius Knight Jr. was drafted specifically to replace Pratt as the starting WILL linebacker, and veteran Oren Burks, a Super Bowl winner with the Eagles, was signed to provide experience and special teams value. Depth Behind Wilson remains on the radar.' },
    { position: 'Cornerback', needLevel: 6, writeup: 'The room is in a much better place than a year ago, thanks to the emergence of DJ Turner II and Dax Hill. Turner had a Pro Bowl-caliber 2025 season and has established himself as a legitimate threat on the boundary. Hill, after bouncing between safety, slot corner, and outside corner since being drafted in 2022, finally found his home. Cam Taylor-Britt is likely departing after a Lisfranc injury ended his 2025 season. With both Turner and Hill entering the final years of their rookie deals, the Bengals could use a healthy mix of veteran depth and a young prospect or two.' },
    { position: 'Safety', needLevel: 8, writeup: 'Geno Stone posted goodbye on social media, signaling his departure. That leaves Jordan Battle as essentially the only safety with NFL starting experience, and while Battle flashed top-10 ability late in his rookie season, the Bengals benched him for veterans in 2024 before he earned his job back.

Baker Mayfield’s QBi of 81.1 (B-) in 2020 remains the best this century for the Browns. Cleveland has multiple first-round picks from last year’s trade with the Jaguars.

After an impressive rookie year (82.3 PFSN QB Impact), Stroud has struggled since, with QB Impact scores of 68.8 (33rd) and 76.2 (19th).

The 36-year-old legend wants market value, and the Saints (projected to be $21 million over the cap) cannot afford both him and Young\'s $20.5 million cap hit.

Recent third-round pick Jordan Burch adds youth. Channing Tindall hits free agency but is easily replaced. The Cardinals have decent depth and recently invested draft capital here.' },

Kalen King, Denzel Burke, Elijah Jones, and Jaden Davis provide depth. Darren Hall hits free agency but is replaceable. The young duo shows promise, but both are unproven and need veteran competition.' },

    { position: 'Quarterback', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Matthew Stafford remains the starter with a massive $48.3 million cap hit and $41.9 million guaranteed, but at 38, succession planning becomes critical. Jimmy Garoppolo provides veteran backup experience, while Stetson Bennett IV serves as the developmental option. With two first-round picks, the Rams are uniquely positioned to select a QB of the future without sacrificing immediate competitiveness. Stafford can still play at a high level, but Los Angeles must evaluate whether to draft his successor now or wait another year. This is more about long-term planning than urgent need.' },
    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Kyren Williams has established himself as the feature back, with Blake Corum providing high-upside depth. Williams, on his rookie deal, and Corum, recently drafted, give the Rams cost-controlled production for the next several years.' },
    { position: 'Wide Receiver', needLevel: 4, writeup: 'Aging veteran Davante Adams ($28 million cap hit, only $6 million guaranteed) serves as WR1, with star Puka Nacua providing elite WR2 production. Adams\' massive cap hit and age make him a potential restructure or trade candidate, especially if the Rams target a quarterback in Round 1.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 6, writeup: 'Colby Parkinson has taken over as the starter, with Tyler Higbee sliding to backup before his contract voids in 2026, making him a UFA at 33. Higbee\'s departure creates a void behind Parkinson, although Terrance Ferguson has flashed in limited reps. If the Rams are comfortable with a Parkinson-Ferguson duo leading the way, then they can largely ignore the position, but they bring in another veteran to complete the room.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Tackle', needLevel: 8, writeup: 'Alaric Jackson mans left tackle with a $24.8 million cap hit and $13 million guaranteed. Right tackle is the critical concern: longtime starter Rob Havenstein hits void status at 34, leaving Warren McClendon Jr. starting with minimal experience. The Rams face a real decision: re-sign Havenstein on a team-friendly deal or draft his replacement. With two Day 1 picks, the second first-rounder could secure a franchise right tackle, or pivot to Round 2 if cornerback takes priority.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Steve Avila at left guard and Kevin Dotson at right guard form a solid interior tandem, with Justin Dedich providing backup depth. Both starters are cost-controlled on manageable deals, making this a position of strength on an offensive line with more pressing concerns at right tackle.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 2, writeup: 'Coleman Shelton holds down center with Beaux Limmer providing backup depth. Neither is elite, but Shelton provides solid play that doesn\'t require immediate replacement. Target a developmental center in Rounds 4-5 who can push Shelton or develop into his eventual replacement.' },
    { position: 'EDGE', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Jared Verse and Byron Young form one of the best young duos in the league, with Josaiah Stewart and Nick Hampton providing depth. Kyle Van Noy (35, UFA) and Marcus Davenport (30, UFA) both hit free agency, but their departures represent natural roster turnover rather than critical losses.' },
    { position: 'Defensive Tackle', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Kobie Turner and Braden Fiske start at defensive end, with Poona Ford at nose tackle and Ty Hamilton providing depth. The Rams could consider adding an interior pass rusher who can develop into a three-technique penetrator, but this position falls far below cornerback and offensive tackle on the priority list.' },
    { position: 'Linebacker', needLevel: 1, writeup: 'Nate Landman and Omar Speights man the inside spots, with Troy Reeder providing veteran backup depth. Neither grades as elite, but the position group is adequate and doesn\'t represent a major roster hole. A Day 3 LB with coverage skills could provide depth and special teams value, but the position doesn’t command premium draft capital.' },
    { position: 'Cornerback', needLevel: 10, writeup: 'Cobie Durant and Emmanuel Forbes Jr. start on the outside, with Roger McCreary (acquired from Tennessee), Darious Williams, Derion Kendrick (UFA), and Ahkello Witherspoon (31, UFA) providing depth. The Rams have no elite CB1 and face potential departures of both Kendrick and Witherspoon. If a top prospect is available with either first-round pick, the Rams must strongly consider pulling the trigger.' },
    { position: 'Safety', needLevel: 1.9, writeup: 'Kam Curl (81.3 PFSN Impact) starts at strong safety but hits free agency at 27, making his re-signing the top defensive priority outside of cornerback. Jaylen McCollough mans free safety with Kamren Kinchens providing backup depth. Losing Curl would create a massive void. If he departs, safety immediately becomes a high-priority need for Rounds 2-3 or free agency. The Rams cannot afford to lose Curl and neglect CB.' }

Mac Jones provides experienced veteran backup depth but will likely find a new home in 2026, competing for a starting role. Regardless, the position is secure with Purdy locked in long-term and capable of leading a championship-caliber offense.' },
    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Christian McCaffrey remains one of the NFL\'s most versatile backs despite age concerns, with Brian Robinson Jr., acquired from Washington, providing quality depth. Isaac Guerendo and Jordan James round out the room.' },

Ricky Pearsall, thrust into the WR1 role as a young player, will lead a decimated corps featuring Kendrick Bourne (UFA), Skyy Moore (UFA), Demarcus Robinson, and Jordan Watkins. The 49ers will essentially all their proven WRs in one offseason. They must be aggressive in free agency and the draft, targeting veteran producers as well as a rising talent or two.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 1.25, writeup: 'George Kittle, Jake Tonges, Luke Farrell, and Brayden Willis are manning the position. Tonges is unproven but developed quickly in Kyle Shanahan\'s TE-heavy offense this year. The group is elite overall, but with Kittle recovering from a torn Achilles, it wouldn’t be surprising if Shanahan and Co. target another depth option.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Tackle', needLevel: 5, writeup: 'Trent Williams continues to start at left tackle despite being 37 with a massive $38.8 million cap hit, creating both short-term stability and long-term concerns. Colton McKivitz ($5.8 million cap hit) mans right tackle, with Austen Pleasants (ERFA) providing depth. Williams remains elite, but his age brings significant retirement risk. A Day 2 developmental tackle who can learn behind Williams for a year makes sense.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 4, writeup: 'Spencer Burford at left guard and Dominick Puni at right guard provide solid interior play, though neither grades as elite. Ben Bartch (UFA) and Matt Hennessy (UFA) both hit free agency, depleting depth. Guard can be addressed early on Day 3 or free agency.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Jake Brendel is adequate, but adding competition through a later draft pick or veteran signing could be prudent. Center isn’t near the top of the priority list, but depth along the interior shouldn’t be ignored.' },

Bryce Huff, acquired from Philadelphia, now starts at left defensive end, while Sam Okuayinonu (RFA), Yetur Gross-Matos (VOID), Robert Beal Jr. (RFA), and Clelin Ferrell (UFA) all face uncertain futures. Keion White, acquired from New England, provides additional depth. The 49ers could have an all-new EDGE group in 2026, possibly including a Top 75 pick at the position..' },
    { position: 'Defensive Tackle', needLevel: 1.75, writeup: 'Jordan Elliott and Kalia Davis start inside, with Alfred Collins, Kevin Givens, and C.J. West providing depth.

    { position: 'Running Back', needLevel: 3, writeup: 'Kenneth Walker III remains the bell-cow starter, with Zach Charbonnet providing TD-hawking RB2 support.

Rashid Shaheed adds game-breaking speed after being acquired via trade. The only concern is Kupp\'s age (33) and injury history. Smith-Njigba\'s emergence as a true WR1 is critical, as Seattle needs him to carry the load.' },
    { position: 'Tight End', needLevel: 1.5, writeup: 'Seattle\'s tight end room is adequate but unremarkable. AJ Barner is the starter, with Eric Saubert and Nick Kallerup providing depth. Rookie Elijah Arroyo landed on IR in 2025.

Charles Cross ($10.9 million on his rookie deal) is an elite left tackle and building block, while Abraham Lucas ($9.4 million cap hit) anchors the right side. Both are young and ascending. The only concern is Lucas\'s injury history, as he\'s dealt with knee issues that cost him significant time.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Guard', needLevel: 6, writeup: 'Grey Zabel shined as a rookie, and Anthony Bradford ($3.8 million) is a raw second-year player at right guard. The entire interior offensive line is under 25 and unproven at the NFL level, although that comes with high upside and cap flexibility. Protecting Darnold ($33.9 million cap hit) must remain a priority.' },
    { position: 'Offensive Center', needLevel: 7, writeup: 'Olu Oluwatimi has graded as an average blocker from the pivot. Jalen Sundell played well in his time, at least better than Oluwatimi, but neither were all that great in 2025. With Zabel and Bradford flanking him, the entire interior is inexperienced and vulnerable. Target a center who is experienced and has showcased proven ability is a must on the free agent market.' },
    { position: 'EDGE', needLevel: 5.5, writeup: 'Uchenna Nwosu carries a $20 million cap hit with a history of missing time, while DeMarcus Lawrence ($11.8 million) is 33+ and declining. Boye Mafe (71.1 PFSN Impact, UFA) is likely to walk in free agency. The concern is the lack of a long-term succession plan; both Nwosu and Lawrence are on expensive contracts with injury/age concerns. In 2026, both should still be productive, but planning for 2027 and beyond is wise.' },
